# DISPATCH — Balance Analyst (v0.2.3) [copy/paste]

Before build finishes:
- Propose prospect frequency targets + KPI expectations (design support)
- Define 2–3 “prospect policies” (accept/reject heuristics) for batch runs

After repo_HEAD:
Run standard harness:
- 250×15 prudent-builder
- 250×15 builder-forward
- 100×30 prudent-builder
- 100×30 builder-forward

Additionally:
- Report prospects incidence rates (how often windows appear; distribution of types; accept/reject outcomes under each policy)
Quote BUILD_INFO identity.
