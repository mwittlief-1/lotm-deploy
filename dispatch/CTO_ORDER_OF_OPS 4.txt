# CTO Order of Operations — v0.2.6
1) DevB (tooling/harness completeness) starts immediately if any harness gaps remain.
2) BE starts tuning loop immediately (KNOBS-based) using baseline v0.2.5.
3) Balance runs DOE grid on each candidate packet; iterates knob recommendations.
4) QA certifies final candidate only (avoid repeated cert cycles during tuning).
5) Deploy + CEO smoke playtest on Vercel after QA PASS.
