# CTO Order of Operations — v0.2.4
1) UX + TA start in parallel
2) Dev B starts now on sim/data changes (no copy)
3) Dev A starts after UX docs arrive (can scaffold with placeholders but no ad hoc copy)
4) BE integrates when DevA+DevB patches ready; runs gates; packages Golden Layout; hands to QA/Balance/Deploy
