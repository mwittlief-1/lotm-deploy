# DISPATCH — UX Writer (v0.2.4) [copy/paste]
Deliver binding UX docs:
- docs/ux/v0.2.4_copy.md
- docs/ux/v0.2.4_info_hierarchy.md

Include copy for:
- Court vs Peasant consumption lines + totals
- Court roster/officer role labels
- Turn Summary top block (“Last 3 years” then “Now choose”)
- Prospects legibility (effects/costs/expires/acknowledgement; shown vs hidden counts)

Constraints: clarity > vibe; tolerate missing fields; no new mechanics.
Deliver as ux_docs_v0.2.4.zip
