# DISPATCH — UX Writer (v0.2.5) [copy/paste]
Please deliver binding UX docs:
- docs/ux/v0.2.5_copy.md
- docs/ux/v0.2.5_info_hierarchy.md

Include copy for:
- Population semantics (population = labor pool) and idle consumption explanation
- Marriage residence messaging (daughters marry out; sons marry in) as simple labels/tooltips
- Consumption label unit consistency (“this turn (3y)”)
- Population change reasons (deaths vs runaways) in turn summary/log
Nice-to-have: obligation input polish labels

Deliver as `ux_docs_v0.2.5.zip`.
