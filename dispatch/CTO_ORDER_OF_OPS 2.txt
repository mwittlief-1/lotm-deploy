# CTO Order of Operations — v0.2.3 (Contract-first + Parallel)

Phase 0 — Lock (now)
- Contract doc locked: `docs/contracts/v0.2.3_prospects_contract.md`

Phase 1 — Parallel start
- UX Writer starts immediately from contract
- Dev B starts immediately: preflight + stub generator
- Balance starts immediately: KPI + prospect policies

Phase 2 — Implementation
- Build Engineer starts engine + logs + exports to contract (integrates DevB patch)
- Dev A starts UI once UX docs arrive (can use stub fixtures meanwhile)

Phase 3 — Verification
- Preflight PASS → then QA full pass
- Balance full pass once per certified candidate
- Deploy Helper updates Stable/Preview after QA PASS
