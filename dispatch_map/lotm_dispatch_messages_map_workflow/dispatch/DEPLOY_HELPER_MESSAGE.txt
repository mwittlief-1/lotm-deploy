Deploy Helper — Map v1 Release Mirror Workflow

Objective
- Ensure deployment mirror repo remains in sync and map assets ship correctly.

Tasks per release candidate
1) Update mirror repo
- unzip release zip -> commit -> tag -> push
- confirm map_v1.json and asset manifest included

2) Vercel config
- ensure SPA rewrites configured for BrowserRouter
- node version + package-lock pinned in mirror repo

3) Smoke check
- open hosted URL and verify:
  - map-lite view loads
  - no missing asset errors (console)
  - APP_VERSION + fingerprint visible
