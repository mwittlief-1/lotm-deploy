Art Lead — Map v1 Visual Language (low-asset, scalable)

Objective
- Provide a minimal, consistent visual system that reduces text density without blocking engineering.

Deliverables
1) assets/manifest.json (or assets_manifest.json)
- Stable keys for:
  - metric icons: food, coin, unrest, court, prospects, death
  - county marker icon (seat)
  - settlement icons by kind (hamlet/village/town/abbey/bishopric if used)
  - fallback crest/icon keys (must exist)
- Validation rule: any referenced key must exist in manifest.

2) docs/art/visual_language_v1.md
- Badge set: Heir, Married, Widowed, Officer (Steward/Clerk/Marshal)
- Tag chips for event/prospect impacts (Food/Wealth/Unrest/Relations/Succession)
- Typography hierarchy: title/subtitle/body/secondary
- No bespoke illustrations required; simple SVG/emoji placeholders acceptable.

Constraints
- No changes to sim.
- Assets must be lightweight and consistent.
- Provide fallbacks so missing art never breaks UI.
