UX Writer — Map v1 + Map-lite UI Copy (clarity only)

Objective
- Provide copy templates and hierarchy guidance for map-lite view without inventing mechanics.

Deliverables
1) docs/ux/map_v1_copy.md
- Section titles: “Realm Map”, “Counties”, “Seats”, “Settlements”
- Hover/selection labels: county name, seat name, settlement name/kind
- Legend text (short): what colors/markers mean
- Empty states: “No map data loaded.”, etc.

2) docs/ux/map_v1_info_hierarchy.md
- What must show on the map view vs in details
- How to show relationship state in a compact way (if displayed)

Constraints
- Presentation-only; do not imply map changes sim outcomes.
- Keep text minimal; rely on icons/legend.
