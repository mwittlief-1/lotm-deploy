Research Analyst — Map v1 Metadata (rails only, no mechanics)

Objective
- Provide a minimal set of historically-plausible region tags and descriptors that can inform presentation (shading/labels) without affecting sim.

Deliverables
1) docs/research/map_v1_metadata_rails.md (1 page)
- Recommended metadata fields and allowed values:
  - region (north/central/south/etc.)
  - rain_band (dry/temperate/wet)
  - soil_band (light/medium/heavy)
- For each field: 1–2 sentence rationale and a citation where possible.

Constraints
- No tuning. No sim coupling.
- Metadata is UI-only until Workpad+Lock later.
