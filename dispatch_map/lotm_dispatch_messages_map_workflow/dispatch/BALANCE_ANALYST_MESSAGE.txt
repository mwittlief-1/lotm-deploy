Balance Analyst — Map v1 Impact & Telemetry (no balance tuning)

Objective
- Ensure map-lite additions remain presentation-only and do not perturb sim outputs.

Tasks
1) Non-perturbation check
- Run a small regression comparison: same seeds/policies before vs after map changes must match sim metrics.
- Confirm sim does not import map.

2) Reporting
- Add a short note in balance report: “Map v1 is presentation-only; no sim inputs.”
