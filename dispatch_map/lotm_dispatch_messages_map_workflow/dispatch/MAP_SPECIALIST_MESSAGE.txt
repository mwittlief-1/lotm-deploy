Map Specialist — Map v1 (map-lite) Build Tasks

Objective
- Produce deterministic map_v1_config + generated map_v1.json for presentation-only use (no sim dependencies).

Deliverables
1) data/map/map_v1_config.json
- width, height
- county count, county IDs and names
- seat placement rules (or explicit seats)
- settlement density rules (or explicit settlements)
- MAPGEN_SEED value to use for generation (static build seed)

2) data/map/map_v1.json (generated)
- schema_version: map_schema_v1
- counties[] (id, name, optional tier/region tags)
- hexes[] enumerated row-major by (q,r)
  - hex_id = hx_<index> (LOCK: no padding)
  - county_id set
- seats[] (county_id -> hex_id)
- settlements[] (kind, hex_id, name optional)

3) docs/map/map_v1_notes.md
- MAPGEN_SEED used
- config summary (width/height, counties, settlement density)
- any intentional design choices

Constraints (must)
- Deterministic: same seed+config => identical map_v1.json
- Fixed neighbor direction order (axial) assumed by validator
- Do NOT add roads/rivers v1
- Do NOT add sim-facing effects; tags may be added as metadata only (region/seat), no mechanics.

Send Engineering
- Confirm chosen width/height and county count; confirm MAPGEN_SEED.
