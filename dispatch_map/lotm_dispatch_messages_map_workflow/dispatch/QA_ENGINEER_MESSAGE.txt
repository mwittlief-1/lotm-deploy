QA Engineer — Map v1 Preflight Gate + Contract Checks

Objective
- Add/extend QA preflight to include map validation + asset manifest checks, and enforce sim/map boundary.

Tasks
1) Add/verify scripts exist and run:
- npm run map:validate
- npm run assets:validate
- npm run boundary:check (fail if src/sim imports map/assets)

2) Add fast tests:
- Map schema snapshot test (map_v1.json matches schema_version map_schema_v1)
- Validate hex enumeration and hex_id derivation (hx_<index>)
- Validate references (county_id, seat hex_id, settlement hex_id)
- Validate adjacency recomputation matches cache if cache present

3) CI/Preflight rule
- Preflight PASS required before full QA gate and before Balance full pass for release candidates.

Deliverable docs
- docs/qa/map_v1_preflight.md (what’s checked, how to run locally)
