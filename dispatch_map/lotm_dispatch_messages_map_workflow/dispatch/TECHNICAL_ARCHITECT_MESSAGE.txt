Technical Architect — Map v1 Contract Review (determinism + boundaries)

Objective
- Review Map v1 design for determinism, boundary enforcement, and growth risk.

Checklist
1) Determinism
- map_v1.json generation deterministic given MAPGEN_SEED + config
- fixed neighbor direction order and derived adjacency
- stable hex_id derivation (hx_<index> no padding)

2) Boundaries
- src/sim must not import map/assets
- map UI reads map data only; sim outputs unchanged

3) Growth risk
- adjacency computation O(n) and safe
- schema forward-compatible (roads/rivers deferred)

Deliverable
- docs/ta/map_v1_review.md (short approval + any risks + required fixes)
