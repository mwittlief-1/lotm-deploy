# Dev Agent B — v0.2.6 Tooling Patch

Baseline: v0.2.5 certified deployable (Golden Layout).

## Goals (Dev B)
- Ensure batch harness supports the full **policy × prospectPolicy × horizon** grid without overwriting outputs.
- Ensure prospects telemetry (windows + outcomes) is correct and present in summaries.
- Add v0.2.6 packet hygiene scaffolding (seeds/knobs/known-issues) and convenience scripts.

## Changes

### 1) Batch artifact folder separation by prospectPolicy (P0 harness)
Updated both batch runners so the default output directory includes the prospect policy dimension:

- `artifacts/<app_version>/<policy_sanitized>/prospects_<prospectPolicy>/turns_<N>/`

This prevents `reject-all` / `accept-all` / `accept-if-net-positive` evidence runs from overwriting each other.

Files:
- `scripts/simBatch.ts`
- `scripts/simBatchNoDeps.mjs`

### 2) Fix no-deps prospects windows telemetry double-count
`scripts/simBatchNoDeps.mjs` previously incremented `windows_total` / `windows_by_turn` twice per turn when a ProspectsWindow existed.
This is now counted **exactly once per window**.

File:
- `scripts/simBatchNoDeps.mjs`

### 3) v0.2.6 harness/packet scaffolding
Added v0.2.6 plan + tasks + stabilization contract docs, plus packet scaffolding files:

- `docs/golden_seeds_v0.2.6.json`
- `docs/KNOBS_v0.2.6.json`
- `docs/KNOWN_ISSUES.md`

Also added convenience scripts:

- `scripts/runHarnessGrid_v026.mjs` — runs the full grid (policies × prospect policies × horizons) via the no-deps runner and verifies output folders.
- `scripts/preparePacketRoot_v026.mjs` — creates a packet-root folder containing BUILD_INFO + golden seeds + knobs + known issues.

# Dev Agent B — v0.2.6.2 DOE + Hardening Patch

Baseline: v0.2.6 certified (0.2.6 was the last certified).

## Summary

This patch adds:

- **WP-12 (marriage-out residency):** married-out children stay in `house.children` (lineage/succession) and are excluded from court membership/consumption via a new `court_exclude_ids` list.
- **Court variants (A/B/C):** deterministic starting-officer presets gated behind `flags._tuning.court_variant`.
- **DOE tuning knobs:** `flags._tuning.fertility_mult` and `flags._tuning.mortality_mult` (defaults 1.0).
- **DOE runner + docs:** a grid runner script and summary artifacts under `artifacts/v0.2.6.2_doe/`.

## Code changes

- `src/sim/court.ts` + `dist_batch/src/sim/court.js`
  - Add `court_exclude_ids` plumbing: `getCourtExcludeIds`, `addCourtExcludeId`, `removeCourtExcludeId`.
  - Court membership/roster generation now skips excluded IDs (defensively never excluding current head/spouse).
  - Add `court_variant` presets inside `ensureCourtOfficers` when `flags._tuning.court_variant` is set.

- `src/sim/turn.ts` + `dist_batch/src/sim/turn.js`
  - WP-12: marriage acceptance no longer splices children out of `house.children`; instead adds to `court_exclude_ids`.
  - Succession: removes `court_exclude_ids` for an heir who becomes head.
  - DOE knobs: apply `fertility_mult` and `mortality_mult` as deterministic multipliers.

- `scripts/simBatchNoDeps.mjs`
  - New flags: `--courtVariant`, `--fertilityMult`, `--mortalityMult`.
  - Default outdir now includes `court_<variant>` in the artifact path.
  - Summary adds debug aggregates: `births_total`, `deaths_total`, `death_no_heir_turn_histogram`.

- `scripts/runDoe_v0262.mjs`
  - Runs the 3×3 DOE grid and writes `artifacts/v0.2.6.2_doe/results.csv` + `results_table.md`.

# Dev Agent A — v0.2.5 UI Patch

Baseline: v0.2.4 certified deployable (Golden Layout).

## Changes (UI-only)

### 1) Consumption labels (3-year turn consistency)
- Removed mixed "bushels/turn (turn=3y)" phrasing in tooltips and breakdowns.
- Updated consumption-related copy to consistently use **"this turn (3y)"** language.
- In *Consumption breakdown*, values now render as plain **bushels** with an explicit note: *All values are for this turn (3y).*

### 2) Turn Summary — population change reasons
- The Turn Summary population line now appends a reason breakdown when present (e.g., **Deaths**, **Runaways**, and any additional keyed causes).
- Implemented tolerant parsing of likely sim report shapes:
  - `population_change_breakdown`, `population_change`, `population_delta_breakdown`, `population_change_reasons`, `population_breakdown`, etc.

### 3) Marriage residence visibility
- Marriage accept toast now reflects residence rule:
  - If the subject child is **female (F)** → shows **"leaves your court"**.
  - Otherwise, if spouse name is known → shows **"spouse joins your court"**.
- Household **House Log** now renders marriage entries (`marriage`, `marriage_arranged`, `marriage_resolved`) including:
  - Basic outcome line (who married / which house).
  - Dowry details when provided.
  - Residence/court-size detail (joined vs left court), using explicit event fields when available or a safe fallback rule.

## Files changed
- `src/App.tsx`

## Notes / Constraints
- No sim logic, data contracts, routes, or screens added.
- No new hooks or conditional hook execution patterns introduced.

## Copy note
- The v0.2.5 binding UX copy pack (`ux_docs_v0.2.5.zip`) was not included in the provided inputs.
- Added only minimal, straightforward player-facing labels (e.g., "Deaths", "Runaways", "leaves your court") to unblock UI wiring.
- If final UX copy differs, these strings should be updated to the binding UX doc once it lands.
