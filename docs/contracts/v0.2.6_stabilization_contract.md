# v0.2.6 Stabilization Contract — Household/Court Economics + 30T Durability (LOCKED)
**Last Updated:** 2026-02-16  
**Owner:** CPO (scope locks) + CTO (engineering contract)

## Context
v0.2.5 passed QA but Balance indicates dynastic-horizon viability collapsed (30T completion near-zero; DeathNoHeir dominates). v0.2.6 is a stabilization release: restore durability without introducing new feature systems.

## Primary goals (measurable)
1) 30-turn viability (prudent-builder)
- 30T completion ≥ 70%
- 30T DeathNoHeir ≤ 20–25% (interim)
- Stable Finish remains meaningful: end_unrest<=40 AND end_arrears_bushels<=100

2) 15-turn baseline stability (prudent-builder)
- 15T completion ≥ 95%
- 15T Stable Finish ≥ 90%
- Avoid early spiral starts (court size / idle labor / bad demographics)

3) Full harness contract for prospects + seeds
- Run prospect decision policies for full pass:
  - prospects-reject-all
  - prospects-accept-all
  - prospects-accept-if-net-positive
- Include golden seeds file in packet
- Include 250×15 and 120×30 for each run policy:
  - prudent-builder
  - builder-forward
  - builder-forward/buffered (diagnostic)

## Scope (allowed)
A) Numbers/tuning only (preferred)
- Court consumption multiplier and/or court headcount initialization
- Fertility/birth rates and age-banded mortality
- Starting-state generation sanity (farmers near stable; small court)
- Prospect relevance thresholds (presentation-only) if contributing to runaway behavior

B) Minimal corrections only if required
- Fix instrumentation regressions (missing policy runs, missing BUILD_INFO in packets, telemetry columns)
- No new gameplay systems; no new screens

## Non-goals
- No new prospect types beyond v0.2.3
- No info-cost mechanic
- No multi-manor or court simulator expansion
- No major UI redesign (clarity tweaks only if needed)

## Workpad rule (hard)
If any semantics change beyond numbers/tuning is required, create a Workpad proposal before implementing.

## Deliverables (required)
- APP_VERSION v0.2.6 + CHANGELOG/TAGS
- Playtest Packet zip including:
  - 250×15 for each run policy × each prospect policy
  - 120×30 for each run policy × each prospect policy
  - batch summaries with windows telemetry + prospect actions + BUILD_INFO.json at packet root
  - 3 exports (good/bad/weird) including at least one birth and one death
  - KNOBS_v0.2.6.json + KNOWN_ISSUES.md
- QA PASS doc: docs/qa/v0.2.6_qa_gate.md
- Balance report: docs/balance/v0.2.6_balance_report.md + knobs
