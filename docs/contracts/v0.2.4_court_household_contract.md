# v0.2.4 Court & Household Contract (LOCKED)
**Last Updated:** 2026-02-15  
**Owner:** CTO (orchestration) + CPO (product locks)

## Goal
Add a mechanic-lite Court/Household accounting layer:
- Court headcount tracked separately from peasant population
- Court vs Peasant consumption computed and displayed (same bushel store)
- Deterministically generated court officer stubs (people only; no bonuses yet)
- Marriage acceptance updates roster: spouse joins court roster by default

## Locked definitions

### A) Court headcount (new)
Court headcount includes (alive only):
- House head
- Spouse or dowager (if present)
- Children
- Court officers (roles: Steward/Advisor, Clerk/Chamberlain, Marshal)
- Spouses who marry into the household via accepted marriage prospect (v0.2 default)

Court headcount is derived from registries / roster tags; no separate population store.

### B) Consumption split (same bushel pool)
- Peasant consumption uses existing logic (based on manor population and labor mix).
- Court consumption is computed separately and added on top.
- Both draw from `manor.bushels_stored`. No second store.

**Court consumption rate (implementation lock):**
Use the same baseline per-person rate already in sim constants:
- `court_consumption = court_headcount * BUSHELS_PER_PERSON_PER_YEAR * TURN_YEARS`

### C) Court officer stubs (new people records, no behavior)
Deterministically generate up to 3 officers at run start:
- Steward/Advisor
- Clerk/Chamberlain
- Marshal

They appear in the roster with role labels + age/alive status.
No bonuses yet; they only affect court headcount/consumption.

**Determinism lock:**
- Officers generated via isolated RNG stream key: `court` (turn_index=0, subkey `court_officers/v0.2.4`)
- IDs deterministic (stable per role)
- Must not perturb existing sim streams.

### D) Marriage updates roster (v0.2.4)
On accepting a marriage prospect:
- subject child becomes `married=true`
- spouse joins court roster by default
- This increases court headcount and court consumption.

### E) Reporting surfaces (must)
TurnReport includes separate lines:
- Peasant consumption (bushels)
- Court consumption (bushels)
- Total consumption (bushels)

Rosters show:
- Court officers with role labels
- Married status and widow/deceased semantics remain correct

## Non-goals
- No multi-manor management
- No info-cost mechanic
- No deep court management system or officer bonuses

## Acceptance
1) Turn report clearly shows Court vs Peasant consumption lines and totals reconcile.
2) Household/Court card shows officer stubs with roles.
3) Marriage acceptance visibly changes household roster (Married + spouse appears in court roster).
4) No regressions in determinism, QA gate, or batch harness (15T + 30T).
