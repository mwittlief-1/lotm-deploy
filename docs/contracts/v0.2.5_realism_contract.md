# v0.2.5 Court + People Realism Contract (LOCKED)
**Last Updated:** 2026-02-16  
**Owners:** CPO (locks) + CTO (engineering contract)

## Goal
A realism pass that tightens semantics for population, court affordability, marriage residence, officer demographics/aging, and UX math consistency—without introducing new major systems.

## P0 Locked requirements

### 1) Population semantics (LOCK)
- `manor.population` represents the **labor pool (working peasants)**.
- `idle = population - farmers - builders` and idle **still consumes**.
- Initialize farmers closer to stable so we don’t start with huge idle by default.

### 2) Court affordability (LOCK)
- Default starting court is small:
  - head + spouse + children + **0–1 officer (steward only)**.
- Clerk and Marshal are not present at start; added later via event/hire (future coin sink), not in v0.2.5.

### 3) Marriage residence (LOCK)
- Daughters marry out (leave player court roster).
- Sons marry in (spouse joins court roster), at least for heir/eldest son.
- Deterministic; no new negotiation system.

### 4) Officers constraints (LOCK)
- Steward/Clerk/Marshal must be male.
- Officers must age each turn.

### 5) Marriage constraints (LOCK)
- Disable same-sex marriages (medieval vibe constraint).

### 6) Food UX math labels (LOCK)
- Consumption labels must be unit-consistent (“per 3 years” / “this turn (3y)”), no mixed per-turn vs per-3y.

### 7) Population change visibility (LOCK)
- When population changes, show why in turn summary/log:
  - runaways vs deaths (and any other tracked cause).

## Nice-to-have (allowed if low risk)
- Obligation payment inputs: fix leading zeros; default to pay full due when possible.

## Defer
- “Who eats first in shortage” choice
- Dowager/remarriage semantics
- Buying bushels / larger coin sinks

## Determinism & gates
- Determinism preserved; any new logic uses existing streams or new isolated stream if required.
- `npm run preflight` PASS (no-deps)
- `npm run qa` PASS (no-deps)
- Batch harness preserved (15T + 30T)
