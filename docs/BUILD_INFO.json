  "notes": "v0.2.7.1 correctness hotfix: enforce aging invariant (all alive People-First registry persons age by TURN_YEARS each turn); resolve succession in the processed turn so preview/report never shows a dead ruler; on succession swap active spouse to the new HoH spouse (via spouse_of kinship edge) while keeping the prior spouse visible via court_extra_ids; marriage acceptance (MarriageWindow + Prospects) writes deterministic spouse_of kinship edges; People-First sync preserves spouse_of edges for player children (prevents wiping child marriages). UI widow badge prefers widowed life-log survivor_id for same-turn accuracy. No new mechanics or tuning changes; retains v0.2.6.2 runtime defaults (court_variant=B; fertility_mult=2.0; mortality_mult=0.8).",
