  "notes": "v0.2.8.1 hotfix (debug+correctness): fixes People-First kinship sync to preserve parent_of facts across succession (prevents child re-parenting / age inversions), adds house↔house relationship deltas for marriage outcomes so A/R/T shifts appear in the ledger, and ensures court/household roles render without placeholders (roles derived from household_roster_view when available). Adds debug UI: View All People registry (with house + parents) and displays parents (name/age/house) in Court roster + marriage offers. Sim: creates/maintains court officer ServiceRecords for downstream obligations/debug. No economy tuning changes."
