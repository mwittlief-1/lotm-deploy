  "notes": "v0.2.7.2 hotfix (P0 only): fixes marriage coherence + prospect attribution and surfaces the fixes in UI. Sim: buildMarriageWindow sources spouse candidates from People-First external houses (prefer local noble houses h_noble_XX) rather than legacy locals.nobles (removes phantom spouses); marriage prospects stamp from_house_id using spouse candidate’s actual house_id (via house scan); spouseIdFromKinship hardened to deterministic selection (lexicographically smallest spouse id) when multiple spouse_of edges exist. UI: marriage prospect card shows spouse name + age + house; roster shows spouse subline per person via spouse_of edges (no global spouse field); Known Houses panel hydrates from house_id lists; Diff Ledger prefers sim-provided diff_ledger items when present; marriage toast mirrors sim residence rule (heir/eldest son brings spouse in; otherwise child marries out). No new mechanics or tuning changes; retains v0.2.7.x runtime defaults (court_variant=B; fertility_mult=2.0; mortality_mult=0.8)."
