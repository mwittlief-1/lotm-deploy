# LoM UX Info Hierarchy — v0.2.7 (Court OS Foundations — Legibility)

**Goal:** Make the turn legible and trustworthy: “what changed, why, what to look at next” — with deterministic ordering and no new mechanics.

---

## Turn Report — top-of-screen (must)

### 1) Identity strip (always visible)
- Turn index
- House / ruler
- Heir indicator (if present in current UI)
- Energy (if present in current UI)

*(Keep this unchanged from current baseline; v0.2.7 adds panels below it.)*

### 2) Diff Ledger (new; first panel under identity)
**Purpose:** immediate snapshot of the biggest deltas + one-line why.

Must show:
- Food (net + stored)
- Coin
- Population (net)
- Unrest
- Top N relationship movers (N=3) with A/R/T deltas

Each line shows:
- signed delta
- one-line why
- one source tag: decision/event/system_pressure/prospect

**Ordering (deterministic):**
- Sort lines by abs(delta) desc, tie-break by stable key.
- Relationship lines use a deterministic score (abs(|ΔA|+|ΔR|+|ΔT|)) and participate in a stable ordering.

### 3) Council Agenda (new; immediately below Diff Ledger)
**Purpose:** 3–5 curated items that point the player to existing parts of the UI.

Must show per item:
- title
- one-line context (“why now”)
- CTA that scrolls/links to an existing section

**Ordering (deterministic):**
- stable scoring + stable tie-break; no RNG.

### 4) Macro Pressure (optional P1; only if implemented)
If present, place below Council Agenda as a compact summary:
- Crown / Church / Local
- one line each

If not implemented: **do not render** the panel.

---

## Existing Turn Report content (unchanged placement; referenced by CTAs)

These sections remain the “details” the Agenda CTAs should scroll to:
- Labor / workforce allocation (if present)
- Food breakdown / stores (if present)
- Obligations breakdown (if present)
- Unrest breakdown (if present)
- Prospects window (if present)
- Household / roster (if present)
- Events log (if present)
- Details/Debug (if present)

> Constraint: Council Agenda CTAs must link/scroll only — no new decision system.

---

## Confidence line placement rules

### Prospects
- In each prospect card, show **Confidence: Known/Likely/Possible** (from `uncertainty`).

### Resolved outcomes / events
- When displaying a resolved outcome line, default to **Confidence: Known**.

Do not show probabilities or percent chances.

---

## “Why” attribution placement rules (Diff Ledger)
- Why must be **one line** below the delta line (or inline as secondary text).
- If multiple causes, use the neutral fallback (“Multiple causes this turn.”).
- Always show a single source tag chip using the allowed tag strings.

---

## Visual density rule (clarity)
- Diff Ledger: ~5–8 lines total (4 core + up to 3 relationship lines).
- Council Agenda: 3–5 items total.
- Anything beyond these belongs in existing Details/sections, not in these top panels.
