# LoM UX Info Hierarchy — v0.2.3 (Prospects MVP)
**Last Updated:** 2026-02-14  
**Goal:** Make prospects and their lifecycle (shown/hidden/accepted/rejected/expired) legible without adding mechanics.

---

## Turn Report — main screen (must show)

### 1) Identity block (top of screen)
Player can answer at a glance:
- **House name**
- **Ruler name + title**
- **Heir** (name or “None”)
- **Spouse status** (if surfaced; incl. widowhood)
- **Energy** (remaining/total)
- **Turn index** (+ years, if available)

### 2) Core survival + economy (always visible)
Keep the “can I survive / am I stable” signals above everything else:
- Food Stores
- Food Balance (3y)
- Unrest
- Obligations (headline total)
- Cash / Income (3y)

### 3) Prospects (new in v0.2.3)
Place **below core metrics**, above long-form event detail, so the player sees opportunities before scrolling.

What’s visible by default:
- Section title **Prospects**
- If any shown prospects exist: the **shown** prospect cards only
- If no shown prospects: the appropriate empty state
- If hidden_count > 0: a **single** neutral hidden-explanation line (no per-prospect reasons)

Per-card “above the fold” content (in order):
1. Type (Marriage / Grant / Inheritance claim)
2. From/To (origin house → player)
3. Summary (1 line)
4. Costs (compact)
5. Expires
6. Actions (Accept / Reject)

Expandable within card (optional “Details” expander):
- Requirements list
- Expected effects
- Confidence

### 4) Events / Life log preview (if present)
Show **only headlines** (up to 3 items) on the main Turn Report.
Deeper text belongs in Details.

---

## Details panel (secondary; expandable)

### A) Obligations breakdown
Use timing labels (due entering turn / accrued / arrears) and keep the helper text visible.

### B) Prospects log (required for v0.2.3 clarity)
Player can verify what happened without needing a debug build.

Must show:
- **Shown vs Hidden counts** (and optionally the id lists)
- A short neutral explanation for hidden items
- Lifecycle events (generated / accepted / rejected / expired)

Optional (if space allows):
- A compact list of the **shown** prospect ids
- A compact list of the **hidden** prospect ids

### C) Full event log
Includes:
- household life events (birth, death, widowhood, succession, heir selection)
- prospect lifecycle events (accepted/rejected/expired)

---

## Micro-interaction hierarchy (what the player experiences)

1. **See prospects** (shown list) before taking other actions.
2. **Act on a prospect** (Accept/Reject) with immediate acknowledgement.
3. **If a prospect expires**, the UI surfaces it via:
   - an **Expired** state on the card, **or**
   - a clear “expired this turn” message + a record in **Details → Prospects log**.
4. **Hidden items are never mysterious**: show a single neutral line + counts; do not show per-item reasons.
