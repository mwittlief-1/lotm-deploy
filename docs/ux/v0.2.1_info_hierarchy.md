# v0.2.1 Info Hierarchy — People First (LOCKED scope)

**Last Updated:** 2026-02-13  
**Owner:** UX Writer (Product Clarity)  
**Scope:** What must be visible on the Turn Report vs. what belongs in expandable details. No new screens/routes.

---

## Primary goal (v0.2.1)

Make the simulation legible by ensuring the player can always answer:
1) **Who is my ruler?**  
2) **Who is my heir?**  
3) **What happened to my household this turn?**  
…without reading raw JSON.

---

## Turn Report — must be visible without expanding anything

### 1) Identity + time (top strip)
- Turn {turn_index}
- Years {year_start}–{year_end}
- House name
- Ruler name + title
- Energy remaining/total

### 2) Household Card (People First) — REQUIRED
Must show in collapsed state:
- Ruler (name + title + optional age)
- Heir (name or “None”)
- Spouse (name or “None”)
- Children count
- Last succession (1 line, or “None recorded”)

### 3) Survival + economy snapshot (existing MVP metrics)
Keep the player oriented without scrolling:
- Food Stores
- Food Balance (3y)
- Unrest
- Obligations (summary)
- Cash
- Income (3y)

> If vertical space is tight, do **not** collapse Household; instead collapse lower-priority breakdowns.

### 4) New Events preview (headline only)
- Up to **3** event titles, then “+{n} more”
- If there are House Log entries this turn, include at least **1** in the preview list.

---

## Expandable “Household details” — belongs under Household Card

When expanded, show:

### A) Family (structured, not raw)
- Spouse (with Widow/Widower badge only when applicable)
- Children list (name + age)
- Heir highlighted with “Heir” badge

Ordering:
1) Ruler
2) Heir (if not ruler)
3) Spouse
4) Children (oldest → youngest, if ages exist; otherwise stable order)

### B) House Log (life events)
- Show newest first
- Each entry shows:
  - Title (Widowed / Heir selected / Succession)
  - Outcome line (one sentence)
  - Turn {turn_index}
  - Optional “Show details” for 1 extra line only

Empty state:
- “No house log entries yet.”

---

## Events panel — what belongs here vs Household

### Keep in Household (People First)
- Household-relevant life logs:
  - widowed
  - heir_selected
  - succession

### Keep in Events (system + economy)
- Food/harvest results
- Unrest changes (if driven by events)
- Obligations / levies / tithes
- Build/upgrade outcomes
- External conditions (when they exist)

> If the UI only has one Events stream today: show House Log items with the **House Log** title + short template copy (do not show raw JSON keys).

---

## Details panel — what belongs here (lower priority)

Only after the player can see identity + household + top metrics:

- Production breakdown (inputs/outputs)
- Consumption breakdown
- Obligations breakdown
- Full event log text (long form)
- Determinism/migration debug (if exposed at all) must be clearly labeled:
  - “Debug” / “For troubleshooting”

---

## Visibility rules (clarity guardrails)

- If a value is unknown/unavailable, **omit** it (don’t show placeholders like “N/A” in primary UI).
  - Exception: Heir should explicitly show **“Heir: None”**.
- Prefer **badges** for status (Heir, Widow/Widower) over sentences.
- Do not show more than **one** banner alert at a time on Turn Report.
- No section should appear empty without an empty-state sentence.
