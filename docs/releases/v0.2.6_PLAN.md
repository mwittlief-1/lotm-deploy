# v0.2.6 PLAN — Stabilize Household/Court Economics + 30T Durability
**Last Updated:** 2026-02-16  
**Owner:** CTO (orchestration)

## Baseline
Start from latest v0.2.5 certified deployable (Golden Layout).

## Strategy (tight loop)
1) Restore durability primarily via KNOBS tuning (no mechanics).
2) Run Balance full grid (run policies × prospect policies × horizons) and iterate knobs.
3) Only if blocked, propose a Workpad semantics tweak (must be approved).

## Likely knob families (expected)
- Court consumption multiplier / court start size
- Fertility / birth chance bands
- Age-banded mortality (esp 65+)
- Starting farmers/builders distribution (reduce early idle)
- Prospect relevance thresholds (presentation-only)

## Gates
- `npm run preflight` PASS (no-deps)
- `npm run qa` PASS (no-deps)
- Full harness artifacts produced per contract
