# v0.2.4 TASKS — Dev Agent B (Sim/Data)
**Last Updated:** 2026-02-15

Implement contract items:
1) Court headcount derivation (alive-only) from roster (head/spouse/children/officers/married-in spouses).
2) Deterministic officer generation (RNG stream `court`, turn_index=0, subkey `court_officers/v0.2.4`; stable person IDs).
3) Court consumption calculation and TurnReport fields:
- peasant_consumption_bushels
- court_consumption_bushels
- total_consumption_bushels
4) Marriage accept updates roster: spouse joins court roster by default.
5) Preserve determinism and bounded snapshots.
