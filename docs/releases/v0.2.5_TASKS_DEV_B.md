# v0.2.5 TASKS — Dev Agent B (Sim/Data)
**Last Updated:** 2026-02-16

Implement P0 locks:
1) Population semantics: population = labor pool; idle consumes; initialize farmers/builders near stable.
2) Court affordability: generate only steward by default (0–1); no clerk/marshal at start.
3) Marriage residence: daughters marry out (remove from court roster); sons marry in (spouse joins), at least heir/eldest son.
4) Officers male + aging: enforce sex=male for officers; age them each turn.
5) Disable same-sex marriage prospect generation.
6) Population change visibility: add TurnReport breakdown (deaths vs runaways).

Deliverable:
- `devB_patch_v0.2.5_sim.zip` (sim/types/tests/docs only) + DEV_NOTES.md
