# v0.2.3 PLAN — Prospects MVP + Relevance Filtering (LOCKED)
**Last Updated:** 2026-02-14  
**Owner:** CTO (Orchestration)

## Goal
Deliver Prospects MVP (Marriage + Grant + Inheritance Claim-only) with deterministic generation, bounded N≤3, required logs, and presentation-only relevance filtering (shown vs hidden). Add preflight gate + stub generator to enable parallel UX/Balance/QA work.

## Inputs
- Baseline repo: `lotm_v0.2.2_repo_CERTIFIED_QA.zip`
- Contract: `docs/contracts/v0.2.3_prospects_contract.md` (LOCKED)

## Non-goals
- No info-cost mechanics (deferred)
- No multi-manor holdings grant (inheritance_claim is claim-only)
- No new screens/routes unless absolutely required (prefer panel/section)

## Success criteria
- Pass preflight + `npm run qa` in no-deps mode
- ProspectsWindow emits schema_version v1; N≤3
- Required log events emitted with required fields
- Non-perturbation holds when no prospects are accepted
