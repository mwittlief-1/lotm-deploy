# v0.2.4 PLAN — Court & Household + Clarity (LOCKED)
**Last Updated:** 2026-02-15  
**Owner:** CTO (orchestration)

## Goal
Implement the v0.2.4 Court/Household accounting layer per the contract, while continuing clarity improvements (turn summary, prospects legibility, shown/hidden explanation). No new management systems.

## Baseline
Start from latest v0.2.3.x certified deployable (Golden Layout), after v0.2.3.4 is locked.

## Workstreams
- Dev B: sim/data model changes (court headcount, officer generation, consumption split, marriage roster updates)
- Dev A: UI presentation (court roster section, consumption split display, turn summary top block)
- BE: integration + gates + packaging (Golden Layout)

## Gates
- npm run preflight PASS
- npm run qa PASS (no-deps)
- Balance harness preserved (15T + 30T)
