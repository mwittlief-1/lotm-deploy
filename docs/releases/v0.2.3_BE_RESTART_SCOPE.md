# v0.2.3 Immediate Scope — Build HEAD Candidate (restart run)

## Inputs to attach to new BE thread
- `lotm_v0.2.2_repo_CERTIFIED_QA.zip` (baseline)
- `devA_patch_v0.2.3.zip`, `devB_patch_v0.2.3.zip`
- `ux_docs_v0.2.3.zip`
- `ta_review_v0.2.3.zip`
- `lotm_v0.2.3_kickoff_contract_first.zip`
- `lotm_v0.2.3_BE_restart_pack.zip` (this pack)

## Do exactly this
1) Unzip baseline into clean workspace.
2) Overlay patches: DevB → DevA → UX → TA → kickoff → addendum v2.
3) Implement Prospects MVP exactly per addendum v2.
4) Run `npm run preflight` and `npm run qa` (no-deps) and ensure PASS.
5) Update versioning and BUILD_INFO + fingerprint; regenerate dist_batch.
6) Produce:
- `lotm_v0.2.3_repo_HEAD.zip`
- `lotm_v0.2.3_playtest_packet_HEAD.zip` (include preflight + qa artifacts)

Stop if anything requires guessing.
