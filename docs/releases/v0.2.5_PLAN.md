# v0.2.5 PLAN — Court + People Realism Pass (LOCKED)
**Last Updated:** 2026-02-16  
**Owner:** CTO (orchestration)

## Baseline
Start from the latest v0.2.4 certified deployable (Golden Layout).

## Workstreams
- Dev B (Sim/Data): population semantics, court affordability start, marriage residence, officer sex/aging, marriage constraint filter, population change breakdown in report.
- Dev A (UI): consistent consumption labels, population change “why” display in turn summary, obligation input polish (nice-to-have).
- BE: integrate patches, run gates, package Golden Layout artifacts.

## Acceptance checklist
1) Population means labor pool; starting allocations sane (no huge idle surprise).
2) Court starts small; only steward officer by default.
3) Marriage residence rules visible in roster changes.
4) Officers male and age forward.
5) Same-sex marriage prospects not generated/shown.
6) Consumption labels are consistent (3y units).
7) Turn summary shows population change reasons (deaths vs runaways).
