# v0.2.3 TASKS — Build Engineer (Integration Owner)
**Last Updated:** 2026-02-14

## Inputs you will receive
- Baseline: `lotm_v0.2.2_repo_CERTIFIED_QA.zip`
- Dev B patch: `devB_patch_v0.2.3.zip`
- Dev A patch: `devA_patch_v0.2.3.zip`
- UX docs: `ux_docs_v0.2.3.zip`
- Contract: `docs/contracts/v0.2.3_prospects_contract.md`

## Must implement
1) Prospects engine (deterministic, bounded N≤3)
- Dedicated RNG stream key `prospects` with stable subkeys per prospect type
- Generate ProspectsWindow v1, including shown_ids/hidden_ids (deterministic)
- Implement prospect lifecycle: expires_turn; emit prospect_expired
- Implement accept/reject actions and apply defined effects; emit required logs

2) Prospect types (LOCKED)
- marriage (full)
- grant (full)
- inheritance_claim (claim-only; flags/relationship deltas only)

3) Required logs (LOCKED)
- prospect_generated (per prospect)
- prospects_window_built (per turn if any prospects)
- prospect_accepted / prospect_rejected / prospect_expired

4) Non-perturbation
- When no prospects accepted, core economy outcomes must match baseline for golden seeds.

5) Artifacts + gates
- Ensure `npm run preflight` PASS
- Ensure `npm run qa` PASS (no-deps mode)
- Update BUILD_INFO + golden seeds v0.2.3
- Produce playtest packet (15T + 30T) and include a run that shows prospects + a run that shows expiry.

## Deliverables
- `lotm_v0.2.3_repo_HEAD.zip`
- `lotm_v0.2.3_playtest_packet_HEAD.zip`
