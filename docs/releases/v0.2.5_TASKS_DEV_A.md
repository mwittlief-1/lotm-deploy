# v0.2.5 TASKS — Dev Agent A (UI)
**Last Updated:** 2026-02-16

Implement P0 UX consistency:
1) Consumption labels consistent with turn=3 years (no mixed “per turn” vs “per 3 years”).
2) Turn Summary shows population change reasons (deaths vs runaways) using report breakdown.
3) Marriage residence visibility: roster updates should make it clear when spouse joined/left court (use existing badges/labels; no new mechanics).

Nice-to-have:
4) Obligations payment inputs: remove leading zeros; default to pay full due when possible.

Deliverable:
- `devA_patch_v0.2.5_ui.zip` (UI-only) + DEV_NOTES.md
