# v0.2.6 TASKS — Dev Agent B (Tooling/QA/Batch/Knobs)
**Last Updated:** 2026-02-16

Primary: make the full harness run reliably and produce complete artifacts.

1) Ensure sim:batch supports prospect policies cleanly:
- reject-all / accept-all / accept-if-net-positive
- applied deterministically each turn
- actions and windows telemetry included in batch_summary

2) Ensure required horizons/policies run and output folders populated:
- 250×15 and 120×30 for each run policy × each prospect policy

3) Packet hygiene:
- BUILD_INFO.json included at packet root
- golden seeds file present for v0.2.6
- KNOBS_v0.2.6.json produced
- KNOWN_ISSUES.md scaffold

Deliverable:
- devB_patch_v0.2.6_tooling.zip (scripts/tests/docs only) + DEV_NOTES.md
