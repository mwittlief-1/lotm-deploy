# v0.2.1 Plan — People First (LOCKED)

**Last Updated:** 2026-02-13

Deliverables:
1) people/houses registries + player_house_id
2) kinship edges: parent_of, spouse_of
3) explicit logs: widowed, succession, heir_selected (marriage offer logs may be placeholders)
4) household card UI (head/spouse/children/heir marker/widow/last succession) using UX copy docs
5) golden seeds updated; 15T regression + 30T batches preserved

No external houses seed in v0.2.1.
