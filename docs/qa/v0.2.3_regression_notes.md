# v0.2.3 Regression Notes

**Date (UTC):** 2026-02-15  \
**QA Owner:** QA Engineer

## Summary

- **Gate result:** **CERTIFIABLE PASS** (both `npm run preflight` and `npm run qa` succeed without `node_modules/`).
- **Primary change theme (contract-first):** Prospects MVP contract introduced with a **preflight gate** enforcing schema + determinism + non-perturbation.

## QA signals observed

### Preflight gate (`npm run preflight`)
- Produced: `qa_artifacts/v0.2.3_preflight.json`
- Result: **3/3 passed**
- Notes (from artifact): determinism seed `lotm_v022_seed_001_baseline_extworld` scanned **12 turns** and observed **12** prospects windows.

### QA gate (`npm run qa`)
- Produced: `qa_artifacts/v0.2.3_no_deps_gate.json`
- Result: **7/7 passed**
- Determinism, invariant clamps, bounded snapshots, policy registry drift, and migration smoke all passed.

## High-signal watch items (non-blocking)

1) **Golden seed suite selection drift**
   - v0.2.3 no-deps gate loaded golden seeds from `docs/golden_seeds_v0.2.1.json` (because there is no `docs/golden_seeds_v0.2.3.json`).
   - `docs/golden_seeds_v0.2.2.json` exists but is not considered in the current fallback order.
   - Recommendation: add v0.2.2 to the candidate list (or add `golden_seeds_v0.2.3.json`) so the gate uses the most recent seed suite.

2) **BUILD_INFO identity looks reused**
   - `docs/BUILD_INFO.json.code_fingerprint` matches v0.2.2 and `notes` text still references v0.2.2.
   - If v0.2.3 is intended to contain meaningful code changes beyond the prospects contract + preflight tooling, confirm the fingerprint/notes generation step is not stale.

3) **package.json version mismatch**
   - `package.json.version` is `0.2.2` while `docs/BUILD_INFO.json.app_version` and `src/version.ts` indicate `v0.2.3`.
   - Not a sim correctness blocker, but it is a common source of release confusion (and can break tooling that relies on npm package version).

## BUILD_INFO.sim_version check

`sim_version = "mvp_v0_1"` matches the compiled sim (`dist_batch/src/sim/version.js`). This appears intentional for v0.2.3.
