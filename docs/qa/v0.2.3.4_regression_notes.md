# v0.2.3.4 Regression Notes

**Last Updated:** 2026-02-16

## Summary

- **QA Gate:** CERTIFIABLE PASS (no-deps, no install)
- Commands executed:
  - `npm run preflight`
  - `npm run qa`

## What’s New / Changed (per build notes)

From `docs/BUILD_INFO.json.notes`:
- Death-turn report roster snapshot + roster dedupe by `person_id`
- Labor oversubscription signal on edit
- Prospects UX: accept/reject toasts, grant helper line, Married badge
- Grant `predicted_effects` populated

## Determinism / Stability

- Preflight determinism scan passed (see `qa_artifacts/v0.2.3.4_preflight.json`).
- No-deps gate determinism checks passed.
- No NaN/Infinity or clamp violations detected in the no-deps invariant sweeps.

## Seed Suite Observations

- The no-deps QA gate loaded golden seeds from `docs/golden_seeds_v0.2.1.json` (n=8).
  - This is **not blocking** for this patch, but it is a **coverage drift risk** if v0.2.3.x expects seed-specific behaviors.

**Recommendation (non-balance):**
- Add `docs/golden_seeds_v0.2.3.4.json` (or a v0.2.3.x file) and update the loader precedence to prefer the closest version match.

## sim_version Sanity

- `sim_version` remains `mvp_v0_1` and matches `src/sim/version.ts`.
- This appears intentional for a UI/ops patch; flag only if the engine version was expected to bump.

## QA Infra Notes

- No-deps fallback remains functional (passes without `node_modules/`).
- Artifacts are written to `qa_artifacts/` with versioned filenames.
