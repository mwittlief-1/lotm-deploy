# v0.2.6 Regression Notes

**Last Updated:** 2026-02-17

## Gate Outcome

- **Result:** CERTIFIABLE PASS
- **Authoritative commands executed (no install):**
  - `npm run preflight`
  - `npm run qa`
- **Artifacts produced:**
  - `qa_artifacts/v0.2.6_preflight.json`
  - `qa_artifacts/v0.2.6_no_deps_gate.json`

## Observations

- No-deps fallback path is healthy (runs cleanly with **no `node_modules/`**).
- Golden seed suite used by the no-deps gate is version-pinned for v0.2.6:
  - `docs/golden_seeds_v0.2.6.json` (n=8)
- Preflight determinism/prospects smoke used seed `lotm_v022_seed_001_baseline_extworld` and observed 12 windows / 12 turns scanned.

## Regressions / Drift

- None detected by the gates.

## Risks / Follow-ups (non-blocking)

- `sim_version` remains `mvp_v0_1`. This appears intentional (matches `src/sim/version.ts` and `dist_batch/src/sim/version.js`) and aligns with the v0.2.6 release notes indicating no mechanics changes.
