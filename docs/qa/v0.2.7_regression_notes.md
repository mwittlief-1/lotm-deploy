# v0.2.7 Regression Notes

**Version:** v0.2.7

## Summary
- QA gate executed in a clean, no-deps environment.
- **CERTIFIABLE PASS** via no-deps fallback.

## What changed (observed from BUILD_INFO / scope)
- v0.2.7 is a **presentation/legibility** release (Diff Ledger + Council Agenda + Confidence labels).
- No sim mechanics changes claimed in `docs/BUILD_INFO.json` notes.

## QA observations
- `qa_artifacts/` contains artifacts for multiple versions (v0.2.6, v0.2.6.2, v0.2.7). This is not a blocker, but consider pruning/isolating per-build in future packaging for clarity.

## Coverage drift watch (non-blocking)
- No-deps gate relies on the golden seed registry present in-repo. If v0.2.7 expects a new seed suite, ensure the registry is version-pinned and updated accordingly.
