# v0.2.6.2 Regression Notes

**Version:** v0.2.6.2  
**Date:** 2026-02-18  
**QA owner:** QA Engineer

## Summary
- **CERTIFIABLE PASS** in a clean/no-deps environment.
- No regressions detected by the no-deps QA gate.

## sim_version sanity
- `docs/BUILD_INFO.json.sim_version = "mvp_v0_1"`.
- This appears **intentional** (no sim engine version bump) and is consistent with `src/sim/version.ts`.

## Notable changes (from BUILD_INFO notes)
- Runtime tuning preset promoted (fertility_mult=2.0, mortality_mult=0.8).
- Default `court_variant = B` at tag time; A and C remain supported.
- No-deps batch runner flag plumbing for `courtVariant`/`fertilityMult`/`mortalityMult`.

## Follow-ups (non-blocking)
- Consider pruning prior-version `qa_artifacts/*` from release zips if you want minimal artifacts (optional).
