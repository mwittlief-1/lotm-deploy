# v0.2.6.2 QA Gate — CERTIFIABLE PASS

**Version tested:** v0.2.6.2 (CTO HEAD zip)  
**Date:** 2026-02-18  
**Gate owner:** QA Engineer  
**Result:** **CERTIFIABLE PASS**

## Build identity (docs/BUILD_INFO.json)
- **app_version:** v0.2.6.2
- **code_fingerprint:** 444e9969cf313e883638611f88dd30e2f05d2f26b688cadd1b54346cda252fc9
- **sim_version:** mvp_v0_1

## Environment / assumptions
- Run executed from a **clean / no-deps** state (no `node_modules/`).
- Gate must succeed via **no-deps fallback**.

## Commands executed
```bash
npm run preflight
npm run qa
```

## Observed outcomes
- `npm run preflight` → **PASS (passed 3/3)**, exit code 0
- `npm run qa` → **PASS (passed 7/7)** via no-deps fallback, exit code 0

## Required artifacts written
- `qa_artifacts/v0.2.6.2_preflight.json`
- `qa_artifacts/v0.2.6.2_no_deps_gate.json`

## Contract checks
### Boundary / sim decoupling
- No boundary violations detected by the QA gate (no sim importing map/assets).

### Determinism
- Determinism suite ran under no-deps gate and passed.

### Invariants
- Invariant suite ran under no-deps gate and passed (no NaN/Infinity; clamps; non-negative energy/resources).

## Notes
- Repo contains older `qa_artifacts/v0.2.6_*` files from prior runs; v0.2.6.2 run artifacts are present and version-stamped as listed above.
