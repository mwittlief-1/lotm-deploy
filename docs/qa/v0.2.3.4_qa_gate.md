# v0.2.3.4 QA Gate — CERTIFIABLE PASS

**Last Updated:** 2026-02-16

## Build Identity (from `docs/BUILD_INFO.json`)

- **app_version:** v0.2.3.4
- **sim_version:** mvp_v0_1
- **code_fingerprint:** 8db4d3970312a5ce1d6c8363cfa1fc041ceb349b543667a0461f1c8a5ee31aa4

## Gate Runs (authoritative, no install)

Environment requirement: **no `node_modules/` present** (no-deps fallback must work).

From repo root:

1) `npm run preflight` → **PASS**
   - exit code: 0
   - artifact: `qa_artifacts/v0.2.3.4_preflight.json`
   - started_at: 2026-02-16T16:28:42.945Z
   - finished_at: 2026-02-16T16:28:45.390Z

2) `npm run qa` → **PASS** (no-deps QA gate)
   - exit code: 0
   - artifact: `qa_artifacts/v0.2.3.4_no_deps_gate.json`
   - started_at: 2026-02-16T16:29:18.316Z
   - finished_at: 2026-02-16T16:29:20.760Z

## Determinism / Invariants Coverage (per no-deps gate)

The no-deps QA gate executed **7/7** checks successfully:

- Determinism: same seed + same policy → identical logs/hashes
- Invariants: no NaN/Infinity; clamps enforced (relationships/unrest 0–100); energy/resources non-negative
- Game-over reasons constrained to allowed registry
- Save/load & snapshot boundedness sanity checks (no nested `log` recursion)
- Golden seed regression: runs deterministic suite for required horizon

## Notes / Gaps

- Golden seeds were loaded from: `docs/golden_seeds_v0.2.1.json` (n=8). If v0.2.3.x intends its own pinned seed expectations, ship a version-matched golden seeds file (and/or update seed selection precedence).

## sim_version Freshness Check

`docs/BUILD_INFO.json.sim_version` is `mvp_v0_1`, and it matches `src/sim/version.ts` and `dist_batch/src/sim/version.js`. This looks intentional for v0.2.3.4.

## Release Note Context

Per `docs/BUILD_INFO.json.notes`, v0.2.3.4 is a patch focused on:

- death-turn report roster snapshot + roster dedupe by `person_id`
- labor oversubscription signal on edit
- prospects UX improvements (accept/reject toasts, helper lines, married badge)
- grant `predicted_effects` population

No new balance tuning was evaluated as part of QA; this gate is strictly correctness/determinism/invariants.
