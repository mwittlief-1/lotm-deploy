# v0.2.3.1 Regression Notes

**Version:** v0.2.3.1  
**Date:** 2026-02-15  
**QA owner:** QA Engineer

## Summary

- v0.2.3.1 passes the authoritative gate in a **no-deps / no `node_modules/`** environment.
- `npm run preflight` and `npm run qa` both complete successfully and write machine-readable artifacts to `qa_artifacts/`.

## Patch verification focus

This rerun was triggered by a post-v0.2.3 patch. The key risk classes re-validated by the gate:

- Determinism stability (seed + policy ⇒ identical output)
- Invariant enforcement (no NaN/Infinity; clamps; non-negative stored values)
- Golden-seed regression run completes

## Artifacts produced

- `qa_artifacts/v0.2.3.1_preflight.json`
- `qa_artifacts/v0.2.3.1_no_deps_gate.json`

## Notes / follow-ups (non-blocking)

1) **Golden seeds file used is still v0.2.1**
   - No-deps QA gate reports loading `docs/golden_seeds_v0.2.1.json`.
   - If seed expectations are meant to be versioned per release, add `docs/golden_seeds_v0.2.3.json` (or v0.2.3.1) and update the gate’s preferred lookup order.

2) **Preflight seed coverage**
   - Preflight currently scans determinism windows on `lotm_v022_seed_001_baseline_extworld` (per `v0.2.3.1_preflight.json`).
   - This is good as a canary; consider adding a second preflight seed that is known to exercise late-turn events.

3) **sim_version appears stable**
   - `sim_version` remains `mvp_v0_1` and matches both `src` and `dist_batch` exports.
   - If a sim engine version bump is desired, update both and regenerate `docs/BUILD_INFO.json`.
