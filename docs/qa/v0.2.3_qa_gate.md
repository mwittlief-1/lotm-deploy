# v0.2.3 QA Gate

**Date (UTC):** 2026-02-15  \
**Gate Owner:** QA Engineer  

## Build Identity

From `docs/BUILD_INFO.json`:

- **app_version:** v0.2.3
- **sim_version (BUILD_INFO):** mvp_v0_1
- **code_fingerprint:** edf67fcfbbac7a3c2b368c43fd7f8c26a01be39fc69fbc3bb70ecaa4b75f10d5

## Verdict

✅ **CERTIFIABLE PASS**

Certifiable because the authoritative gate commands executed successfully in a **no `node_modules/`** environment via the intended **no-deps** paths, and wrote machine-readable artifacts to `qa_artifacts/`.

## Commands Executed (authoritative)

From repo root (no install):

```bash
npm run preflight
npm run qa
```

### Observed Output

Preflight:
- `preflight: PASS (passed 3/3)`

QA:
- `Vitest not found (node_modules missing). Running no-deps QA gate...`
- `qa_no_deps: PASS (passed 7/7)`

**Exit code(s):** 0

## Machine-Readable Artifacts (required)

- `qa_artifacts/v0.2.3_preflight.json` (PASS, 3/3)
- `qa_artifacts/v0.2.3_no_deps_gate.json` (PASS, 7/7)

## Coverage Summary

### Preflight Gate (`npm run preflight`)
Implements the **LOCKED minimum set** from `docs/contracts/v0.2.3_prospects_contract.md`:

1) ProspectsWindow schema snapshot (v1)
2) Determinism smoke (same seed + same decisions ⇒ identical ProspectsWindow ids + fields)
3) Non-perturbation when no prospects accepted (baseline captured in `docs/qa/v0.2.3_non_perturbation_baseline_v0.2.2.json`)

### QA Gate (`npm run qa` → no-deps)
Validated (via `scripts/qaNoDeps.mjs`):

1) Determinism (same seed + same policy ⇒ identical logs)
2) Golden seed regression (15 turns) — invariants pass
   - `prudent-builder` (first 8 golden seeds)
   - `builder-forward` (first 8 golden seeds)
3) Invariants / clamps
   - No NaN/Infinity
   - `0 ≤ unrest ≤ 100`
   - Relationships `A/R/T` clamped to `0..100`
   - `energy.available/max ≥ 0` and `available ≤ max`
   - Non-negative stored resources + arrears
   - Labor allocation `farmers + builders ≤ population`
   - Game-over reasons restricted to allowed set (`Dispossessed`, `DeathNoHeir`)
4) Bounded snapshots
   - Snapshots do not contain `log` and only include an allowed key set
5) Policy registry drift checks
   - `docs/BUILD_INFO.json.policy_ids` matches `POLICY_IDS`
6) Policy behavior sanity
   - `builder-forward` starts with `field_rotation` when viable
7) Back-compat smoke (fixture)
   - v0.1.0 fixture can be proposed/migrated by `proposeTurn()` without crashing

## BUILD_INFO.sim_version freshness check

`docs/BUILD_INFO.json.sim_version = "mvp_v0_1"` matches the compiled sim (`dist_batch/src/sim/version.js`). This appears **intentional** for v0.2.3 (not stale).

## Notes / Known Gaps (non-blocking)

- The no-deps QA gate loaded golden seeds from `docs/golden_seeds_v0.2.1.json` (because `docs/golden_seeds_v0.2.3.json` is not present and `qaNoDeps.mjs` currently falls back to v0.2.1 before considering v0.2.2).
  - If v0.2.3 is intended to inherit v0.2.2 seeds, update the candidate list (or add a v0.2.3 seeds file) so the gate automatically uses the most recent seed suite.

- `docs/BUILD_INFO.json.code_fingerprint` matches v0.2.2’s fingerprint and the BUILD_INFO notes text still references v0.2.2. If v0.2.3 is meant to be more than “contract + preflight additions,” confirm the fingerprint/notes generation step is running as intended.
