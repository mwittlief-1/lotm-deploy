# v0.2.3.3 Regression Notes

**Last Updated:** 2026-02-16

## Summary

- **QA Gate:** CERTIFIABLE PASS (no-deps, no install)
- Commands executed:
  - `npm run preflight`
  - `npm run qa`

## What’s New / Changed (per build notes)

From `docs/BUILD_INFO.json.notes`:
- Completion patch focused on playtest/batch artifact hygiene and prospects telemetry surfaced in `batch_summary`.
- No new gameplay/mechanics intended.

## Determinism / Stability

- No-deps gate determinism checks passed.
- No NaN/Infinity or clamp violations detected in no-deps invariant sweeps.

## Seed Suite Observations

- The no-deps QA gate loaded golden seeds from `docs/golden_seeds_v0.2.1.json` (n=8).
  - This is **not blocking** for this patch, but it is a **coverage drift risk** if v0.2.3.x expects seed-specific behaviors.

**Recommendation (non-balance):**
- Add `docs/golden_seeds_v0.2.3.3.json` (or a v0.2.3.x file) and update the loader precedence to prefer the closest version match.

## sim_version Sanity

- `sim_version` remains `mvp_v0_1` and matches `src/sim/version.ts`.
- This appears intentional for an operational patch; flag only if the engine version was expected to bump.

## QA Infra Notes

- No-deps fallback remains functional (passes without `node_modules/`).
- Artifacts are written to `qa_artifacts/` with timestamps + versioned filenames.
