# v0.0.8 Task List (Checklist)

**Last Updated:** 2026-02-11

## Harness fidelity
- [ ] builder-forward does not start with village_feast if productivity-first options are viable
- [ ] builder-forward/buffered exists and uses buffered behavior
- [ ] Policy ID sanitizer '/' -> '__' applied consistently
- [ ] scripts/simBatch.ts default outdir includes turns_<N> to prevent artifact clobber

## Telemetry
- [ ] per-run CSV includes: had_active_construction, turns_construction_active
- [ ] improvement completion booleans (granary/rotation/drainage/watch/mill/physician/feast/retinue)
- [ ] min/max metrics: max_unrest, min_bushels, min_coin, max_arrears_bushels, energy bounds, relationship bounds
- [ ] policy identity columns: policy_logical, policy_canonical, policy_artifact_folder
- [ ] horizon_turns in rows + summary

## QA correctness
- [ ] golden seeds v0.0.8 run 15 turns in tests
- [ ] npm run qa emits machine-readable artifacts
- [ ] no-deps QA path checks BUILD_INFO policy_ids vs registry

## Docs
- [ ] RUN.md documents 15-turn + 30-turn commands and Stable Finish + tails
