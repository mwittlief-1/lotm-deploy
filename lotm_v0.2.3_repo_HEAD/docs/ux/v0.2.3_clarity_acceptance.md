# LoM UX Clarity Acceptance — v0.2.3 (Prospects MVP)
**Last Updated:** 2026-02-14

User-visible outcomes (acceptance criteria):

1. The Turn Report always shows **House name, Ruler, Heir, Energy, and Turn index** at the top without scrolling.

2. When prospects exist, the Turn Report shows a **Prospects** section that is visually distinct from the event log.

3. Each shown prospect card displays (at minimum): **Type**, **From/To**, **1-line Summary**, **Costs** (when present), **Expires**, and **Actions** (Accept/Reject).

4. Accepting or rejecting a prospect produces an **immediate acknowledgement** (e.g., toast/snackbar) that clearly states the action: “Prospect accepted.” / “Prospect rejected.”

5. A prospect that reaches its expiry does **not silently disappear**:
   - The UI either shows the card in an **Expired** state, **or**
   - The UI shows a clear message (“A prospect expired this turn…”) and the expiration is recorded in **Details → Prospects log**.

6. If prospects are hidden, the UI shows a **neutral 1–2 line explanation** and a **count** (shown vs hidden). It does **not** require or display per-prospect hidden reasons.

7. The player can view **what was shown vs hidden** at least in **Details/Debug**, including counts (and optionally the id lists).

8. If the player attempts to act on a non-actionable prospect (expired/already decided), the UI shows a clear error message (e.g., “This prospect has expired.” / “Already decided.”) and does not apply the action.

9. Requirements/costs/effects labels have **short tooltips** that explain what each section means without implying new mechanics.

10. The prospect lifecycle is visible in the logs: **generated**, **accepted**, **rejected**, and **expired** entries are readable as plain-language lines in the event/details view.
