# v0.0.8 Plan — Measurement + Harness Fidelity + 30-turn Readiness

**Last Updated:** 2026-02-11

## Scope
No new gameplay systems. This release is harness/telemetry + evaluation-contract only.

## Musts
### Policy IDs
- prudent-builder (alias: good-faith -> prudent-builder)
- builder-forward (canonical temptation productivity path)
- builder-forward/buffered (diagnostic buffered variant; artifact folder sanitized '/' -> '__')

### Batches
- Regression: 250×15 for prudent-builder + builder-forward (+ optional buffered)
- Readiness: 100–150×30 for prudent-builder + builder-forward

### KPIs (new standard)
- Completion rate
- Stable Finish:
  - end_unrest <= 40 AND end_arrears_bushels <= 100 AND not game_over
- Tails:
  - % ending unrest >= 80
  - % ending arrears_bushels >= 1000
  - % where min_bushels == 0

### Telemetry (per-run CSV)
Must include:
- had_active_construction + turns_construction_active
- improvement completion booleans
- max_unrest, min_bushels, min_coin, max_arrears_bushels
- policy_logical + policy_canonical + policy_artifact_folder
- horizon_turns

### QA
- golden seeds = v0.0.8 set, full 15-turn horizon
- npm run qa authoritative with machine-readable artifacts (vitest if available, else no-deps gate)

## Deliverables
- lotm_v0.0.8_repo.zip
- lotm_v0.0.8_playtest_packet.zip (15-turn + 30-turn batches)
- docs/balance/v0.0.8_balance_report.md + knobs
- docs/qa/v0.0.8_qa_gate.md PASS/FAIL + regressions
