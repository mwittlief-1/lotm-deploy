# v0.2.3.2 PLAN — Polish + Correctness Patch (LOCKED)
**Last Updated:** 2026-02-15  
**Owner:** CTO (Orchestration)

## Goal
Ship a v0.2.3.2 patch that fixes People/Household correctness issues and improves key UI clarity, based on CEO human playtest + CPO review, without adding new mechanics.

## Baseline
Start from the latest deployable v0.2.3.1 certified repo zip (Golden Layout).

## P0 Correctness (must)
1. Household list: each person appears once; heir is a tag/badge, not a duplicate row.
2. Widowed semantics: widowed applies to surviving spouse; deceased spouse shows Deceased; household state matches house log.
3. Prevent repeated spouse-death logs unless truly multiple events.
4. Age sanity:
   - deterministic init rule: first child at husband age 22, wife age 18 (no randomness yet)
   - cap old-age survival so rulers don’t reach ~120 (hard cap and/or steepened mortality 65+)
5. Labor allocation never exceeds population:
   - if pop drops, clamp/rebalance immediately (builders first, then farmers)
   - show a clear warning (UX copy provided)
   - allow fixing oversubscription without being blocked by delta cap

## P1 Clarity (ship in same patch)
6. Prospect accept/reject immediate confirmation; update household child married status at minimum.
7. Disable/remove legacy Marriage Window UI when Prospects marriage is active (avoid dual systems).
8. Obligations: move payment inputs adjacent to obligations due; make manual nature obvious.
9. End Turn: visibly confirms and scroll/resets so it’s obvious the turn advanced.
10. Unrest: add a delta breakdown (contributors up/down).

## Additional P1 polish (recommended)
11. Construction options: already-built improvements removed/disabled with clear “already built” messaging.

## Not in scope (defer)
- Bushel buying with coin
- New coin sinks / deeper economy realism
- Deep inbound/outbound marriage semantics (moving people between houses, in-laws)
- New prospect types or info-cost mechanics

## Gates
- `npm run preflight` PASS (no-deps)
- `npm run qa` PASS (no-deps)
- Deploy zip uses Golden Layout (zip root = Vite project root) and includes `package-lock.json`
