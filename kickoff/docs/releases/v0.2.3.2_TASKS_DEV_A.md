**Last Updated:** 2026-02-15

## Inputs
- Baseline repo zip: latest v0.2.3.1 deployable certified (Golden Layout)
- UX docs in this package: `docs/ux/v0.2.3_copy.md` (includes v0.2.3.2 patch addendum)
- NOTE: Do not reintroduce hook-order violations in App.tsx (all hooks unconditional).

## Scope (P1 Clarity + minor polish)
6) Prospects accept/reject confirmation
- Show immediate acknowledgement (toast/banner) on accept/reject.
- Ensure married status is visible in household card (tag/label) after acceptance.

7) Disable legacy Marriage Window when Prospects active
- Hide/disable the old Marriage Window UI if Prospects are present for the turn.

8) Obligations placement clarity
- Move payment inputs adjacent to obligations due/arrears.
- Use UX copy to emphasize payments are manual.

9) End Turn feedback
- After End Turn, show “Turn X resolved” banner/toast and scroll to top.

10) Unrest delta breakdown
- Render unrest change breakdown (up/down contributors) from structured data provided by sim.

11) Construction options
- Disable/remove already-built improvements in the construction selector.
- Use UX “Already built” style copy if available; otherwise disable with existing labels (no invention).

## Deliverable
- `devA_patch_v0.2.3.2_ui_polish.zip` with UI-only changes + `DEV_NOTES.md`.
No sim changes.
